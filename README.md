# CSE_GradingScript

## What this script does
This script modifies the project file for each submission so that each student's project can
be imported into eclipse at the same time.

## Requirements
* Python 3.x

## How to use

##### Running the script

1. Download the zip of project files from carmen by going to course page on osu.instructure.com
   Then go to `Assignments` -> `Project N` -> `Download Submissions`
2. Double click `GradingScript.py` or run `python GradingScript.py`
3. Type the path to the `submissions.zip` file. This will create a directory `submissions` in the same folder
   as `submissions.zip`

##### Importing

You can now import all of the projects from the `submissions` directory into eclipse.
